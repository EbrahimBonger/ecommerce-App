## Application Requirements
The website should be able to display products being sold in several categories. A user visiting your web store application can search for products (i.e., search for a specific item name and display that item) or display all items in a certain category. The website should display the available quantity for each product.

Only a logged in user can add products to a shopping cart and "buy" various quantities of products by checking out. To "buy" a product means to reduce the quantity from that product with the quantity that was "bought" (i.e. your database should be updated to reflect the reduction in quantity of items after purchase). 

A logged in user shopping cart can be viewed, edited, checked out or deleted. A logged in user can also see his/her orders history if there are any.
